/**
 * Base behavior for a matcher
 *
 * Matches west - mid - east
 * - west side   ... model
 * - mid station ... view model
 * - east side   ... view
 *
 * Each side registers its 'matchables' once it participates
 * Registering is not static, every modification in the structure
 * will be reported to the matcher
